# Problem Solving Bootcamp by Megaminds

This repo will be used for assignment purposes of the Megaminds bootcamp on problem solving.

# Test Case Considerations
Take the following considerations while making test cases or corner cases

- First, do you fully understand the problem?
- Given array is sorted or unsorted?
- Same number or charecter can repeat or not?
- Is negative number is allowed? what is the range of input?
- How many solutions are there?

# Possible Solutions Approach:

- Brute force
- Two pointer
- Sorting
- Map for frequency/Set for unique
- Greddy [Longest Path Type]
- Dijkstra algorithm [Shortest Path Type]
- Knapsack Problem
- Gauss's Summation Formula
- Recursion / Dynamic Programming
- Minnie-Max
- BFS / DFS
- Graph theory
